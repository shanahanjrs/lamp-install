lamp-install
============

Shell script to install a LAMP server stack

Currently only works on Debian based systems using apt-get.

Future implementations will download and compile everything
from source making it portable.

To use just run
$ sudo ./lamp-install

Can currently install and remove an installation.
The options to remove and debug/configure have not yet
been finished, but i'll get it to soon :)
